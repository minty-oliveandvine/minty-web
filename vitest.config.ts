// Unit and component tests. Playwright lives in e2e/ and features/*/e2e/ and is NOT run from
// here -- `test.exclude` keeps the two runners apart, because a .spec.ts written against
// Playwright's `test`/`expect` would otherwise be collected by vitest and fail with an error
// about the wrong runner rather than about the code. (onboarding's config, same reasoning.)
//
//   npm test          once, no browser -- the per-commit gate
//   npm run test:watch
//   npm run test:e2e  Playwright, needs the stack up (see e2e/README.md)
